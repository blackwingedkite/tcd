HI,

the Bert\_Model\_trainning.ipynb is the code that train the model. It have shown how to train our model, however, it takes a long period to run. After the model was trained well, we download the data into model\_weight.h5, which is in the DA\_ML final.

The fronted-end related stuff is in the DA\_ML final>app, when running app.py, the python flask framework will start working, and HTML and CSS file is in the templates folder.

The only thing worth noting is that the direction of each data may not be valid, and based on the requirement "Do not upload the dataset", the dataset can not be seen in the zip file. If you want to take a look in the dataset, please let us know.

If the app.py fail to work, it may be the problem that your working environment related issue. You can consider trying virtual environment with anacoda.
